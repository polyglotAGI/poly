# PolyglotAGI Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Establish Cognitive Architecture

### Tasks:
- Implement cognitive architecture based on **SOAR** or **ACT-R** for reasoning, memory, and decision-making.
- Set up short-term and long-term memory systems to store problem-solving states and retrieve knowledge dynamically.
- Integrate NLP models like **GPT-4** or **BERT** to enable language understanding and generation.

## Phase 2: Develop Agent Swarm Framework

### Tasks:
- Create specialized agents for different tasks such as data processing, web scraping, and computation-heavy operations.
- Enable agent-to-agent communication and collaboration through dynamic swarms.
- Equip agents with language-specific toolkits:
  - Python agents with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow.
  - JavaScript agents with React, Vue, and Node.js for web-based tasks.
  - C++ agents with high-performance computing libraries.

## Phase 3: Multi-Modal and Multi-Model Integration

### Tasks:
- Set up integration of models for different sensory data inputs (vision, NLP, audio, etc.).
- Implement **sensor fusion** techniques to combine data from different inputs.
- Develop cross-domain AI model collaboration to improve multi-modal problem-solving.

## Phase 4: Build Retrieval Augmented Generative Engine (RAGE)

### Tasks:
- Create a **retrieval-augmented system** that can query databases and generate context-specific responses.
- Integrate a generative model (e.g., GPT-4) with retrieval-based systems for real-time, relevant problem-solving.

## Phase 5: Implement Recursive Self-Learning Mechanisms

### Tasks:
- Develop **continuous learning systems** that allow the AGI to learn from new data incrementally.
- Implement **self-supervised learning**, where the AGI generates its own training data by interacting with its environment.
- Integrate feedback loops for self-assessment and optimization.

## Phase 6: Ethical and Safety Framework

### Tasks:
- Embed ethical decision-making protocols such as "do no harm" to ensure responsible AGI behavior.
- Implement safety checks, fail-safes, and transparency mechanisms for autonomous operations.

## Phase 7: Prototype Development

### Tasks:
- Develop prototypes that demonstrate language selection proficiency across multiple programming languages.
- Enable **agent collaboration** for solving complex problems, such as building web applications that use both Python for back-end analytics and JavaScript for front-end visualization.

## Development Tools:
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow (for multi-modal and NLP processing).
- **Cognitive Architectures**: SOAR, ACT-R for mimicking human thought processes.
- **Language Models**: GPT-4, BERT for language understanding and generation.
- **Agent Toolkits**:
  - Python: Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow.
  - JavaScript: React, Node.js.
  - C++: High-performance libraries.
